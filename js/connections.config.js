/* CardHound connections and feature gating: ONE config file.
 * Decision (BigM00, DATA-FEED-OPTIONS.md, Oct 4 2026): bring-your-own only for eBay (official OAuth) and PSA
 * (user-generated API token). Everything else is import-only, not available yet, or pending a partnership.
 * NEVER collect passwords, cookies or session tokens. No scraping.
 *
 * status: "available"  -> Not connected / Connected (demo)
 *         "coming"     -> Coming soon
 *         "partner"    -> Pending partnership
 *         "na"         -> Not available yet
 *         "importonly" -> Import only (opens Import my collection)
 *         "feed"       -> CardHound's own licensed data (internal, coming soon)
